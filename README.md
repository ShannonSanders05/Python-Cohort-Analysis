## Project Title: Python-Cohort-Analysis

**Description**:

In this Python project, I conducted a cohort analysis on an online retail dataset sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii. The primary objectives and steps of the project include:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Accessed and retrieved the online retail dataset from the provided UCI Machine Learning Repository link.
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Explored the dataset, identifying key features, and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.
3. **Cohort Formation**: Created cohorts based on user retention, grouping customers by their initial purchase dates to analyze their behaviors over time.
4. **Retention Analysis**: Performed cohort analysis to assess user retention rates and identify patterns in customer engagement over subsequent periods.
5. **Data Visualization**: Utilized Python visualization libraries (such as Matplotlib and Seaborn) to present cohort analysis results in a visually comprehensible manner.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Extracted actionable insights from the cohort analysis to make recommendations for improving customer loyalty and engagement.
